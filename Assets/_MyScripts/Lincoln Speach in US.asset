  storyText: The Gettysburg Address was delivered at the close of the dedication
    ceremony, after politicians, generals, and dignitaries paid tribute to the men
    buried in the cemetery. The speech was photographed from multiple angles, and
    Edward Everett, the chief speaker at the ceremony, was so impressed that he wrote
    to Lincoln the next day.
