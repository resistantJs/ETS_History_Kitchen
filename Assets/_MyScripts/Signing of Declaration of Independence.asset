  storyText: The Declaration proclaimed the Thirteen colonies were now "free and
    independent States", no longer colonies of the Kingdom of Great Britain and,
    thus, no longer a part of the British Empire. Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin,
    and John Adams all wrote that it was signed by Congress on the day when it was
    adopted on July 4, 1776.
